Project Description: Nginx Virtual Block Creation Script with WordPress Configuration

This project aims to streamline the process of setting up virtual blocks in Nginx and provides a convenient script for automating the creation of virtual blocks. Additionally, it includes a sample configuration for running WordPress with Nginx.

The script included in this repository simplifies the creation of virtual blocks by automating the necessary steps. It prompts the user for essential information such as domain name, port, and root directory, and generates the corresponding Nginx configuration file. This script eliminates the need for manual configuration, reducing the chance of errors and saving valuable time during the setup process.

In addition to the virtual block creation script, this repository also provides a sample configuration file for running WordPress with Nginx. The configuration file contains the necessary directives and settings to ensure proper functionality of a WordPress site hosted on an Nginx server. It includes configurations for handling PHP requests, URL rewriting, and other essential settings for WordPress compatibility.

The project aims to simplify the deployment of WordPress sites on Nginx servers by offering an automated script for creating virtual blocks and providing a reliable configuration template.
